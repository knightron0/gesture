Are you ready to take your communication skills to the next level? Our AI-powered ASL learning app, gesture, is here to help you unlock the power of American Sign Language.

**But why is learning ASL so important?** In a variety of situations, being able to communicate effectively with deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals can make all the difference. Consider medical emergencies, where an individual may be unable to communicate verbally due to pain, trauma, or a medical condition. Knowing ASL can help quickly convey important information about the person's condition, allergies, medications, and any other relevant details, potentially saving lives. Other cases such as natural disasters, fire emergencies, and law enforcement encounters similarly require fast communication between those that may not be able to speak and those that do not know ASL. Even just simple communication with the deaf community in our daily lives can be improved with better ASL literacy or machine-assisted interpretation. Situations like these are where gesture can help bridge the communication barrier.


**gesture** uses artificial intelligence to interpret ASL fingerspelling, providing an efficient way to learn and practice sign language. Plus, with our cutting-edge machine learning and augmented reality technology, you can ensure accurate interpretation and an immersive learning experience.

Through our mobile app, itâ€™s extremely easy for people to start their journey with ASL. We utilize a retrained version of YOLO-v8, a popular state-of-the-art object detection machine learning model, to provide users with real-time feedback on the correctness of their signs as they explore ways to improve by interacting with our 3D models in both AR and object mode. Our website offers similar services, as people can get their gestures validated straight from the browser without any setup required. The interpret mode on our app can recognize ASL letters in real-time, facilitating communication that would not be possible otherwise.  


With gesture, you can unlock the power of ASL and join us in inspiring communication and cultivating connection.
